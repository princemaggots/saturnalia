      The Life Stage of Solar Systems (Stars)

        Stars, like gas giants, contain mainly hydrogen and helium.  They are actually made up of around 87% hydrogen, and only 10% helium. 
        They also contain 3% of other elements, such as calcium. </p>
      <p>
        
      We can figure out what exactly a star is made of using their spectrum lines. Spectrum lines identify what molecules or elelements are present in a light source via absorption and emission lines. Absorption lines are dark lines and are due to certain photons being absorbed, causin electrons to move energy levels. Emission lines, the inverse of absorption lines, occur when electrons are moving between energy levels.

      <p>
        Stars maintain their size by constantly undergoing nuclear fusion, converting their hydrogen to helium. Some stars are bigger than others
