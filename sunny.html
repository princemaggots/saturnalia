        Stars, like gas giants, contain mainly hydrogen and helium. They are made of mostly hydrogen at their start, but through nuclear fusion (which they do constantly to maintain their size) convert this all to helium. 
        They also contain 3% of other elements, such as calcium. </p>

      We can figure out what exactly a star is made of using their spectrum lines. Spectrum lines identify what molecules or elelements are present in a light source via absorption and emission lines. Absorption lines are dark lines and are due to certain photons being absorbed, causin electrons to move energy levels. Emission lines, the inverse of absorption lines, occur when electrons are moving between energy levels.
