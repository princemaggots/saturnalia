        Terrestrial planets are similar to Earth, with few moons and a partially or fully liquid core. They're made up of mainly silicates (silicon-oxygen compounds) and iron compounds. 
        The core of terrestrial planets is made of metals (namely iron) due to a process known as differentiation. Differentiation in astronomy is the process of gravity and heat melting the inside of a planet to 
        cause denser materials to sink to the bottom (like iron and nickel) and less dense materials, like silicon and oxygen, to rise to the top.

      Inside our solar system, the planets that were closest to the sun 
        (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) 
        became terrestrial planets, both due to the sun's gravitational attraction (which denser objects like metals woukd be more attracted to) and the then blowing off of their gases via the sun's stellar winds, which are blasts of energy and particles.</p>
