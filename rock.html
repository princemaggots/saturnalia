        Terrestrial planets are made up of mainly silicates (silicon-oxygen compounds) and iron compounds. Astronomers theorize that the core of terrestrial planets is mainly made up of iron, due to differentiation.  
        Differentiation, which happens when a planet is heated above 1300K, is when gravity causes denser materials such as iron and nickel, to sink to the bottom and materials that are less dense, such as silicon and oxygen, 
        to rise to the top. In terrestrial planets, this core is also partially solid and partially liquid.
