      Terrestrial Planet Composition

        Terrestrial planets are made up of mainly silicates (silicon-oxygen compounds) and iron compounds. 
        Astronomers theorize that the core of terrestrial planets is mainly made up of iron, due to differentiation. 
        Differentiation in this sense is when gravity causes denser materials such as iron and nickel, to sink to the bottom and materials that are less dense, 
        such as silicon and oxygen, to rise to the top. In terrestrial planets, this core is also partially solid and partially liquid. 
        In our solar system, the planets closest to the sun became terrestrial, both due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, which denser objects like metals would be more attracted to, and 
        the blowing off gases due to 
        stellar winds, which are blasts of energy and particles.
