In stars larger than 3 solar masses, when they die, they collapse and form a black hole. Black holes are incredibly dense, with gravitational pulls so strong that evenlight cannot escape its grasp. We cannot see these directly, as our eyes are made to see photons. They are observable due to this gravitational pull. When matter is dragged into a black hole, it releases a ton of gamma and X-rays, which helps us spot it. 
        
        The end of solar systems begins with the death of a star. Stars generally live for billions of years, with bigger stars living shorter lives and smaller stars living longer because it takes more energy to offset the gravitational force of a giant star than a small star. Once a star can no longer do nuclear fusion (aka it runs out of hydrogen to fuse together), it collapses on itself. This makes the star extremely hot due to both the energy of collapsing and its small size. The hydrogen outside of a star still exists, however, so it continues to fuse. This makes the star even hotter, so the outer star layers are pushed outward. As these layers expand and cool, the star becomes a red giant. </p>
        <p>
          Most stars upon the end of their lifespan become white dwarfs after all its outer layers have been pushed out, revealing an incredibly hot core. These white dwarfs do not collaspe further due to fast-moving electrons inside it creating pressure. Eventually however, these stars cool down and fade away due to not being able to produce energy anymore. This will one day be the case with our sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of a solar system with multiple stars, something different may happen when one of those stars die - a nova. This is when a white dwarf close enough to another star pulls in hydrogen from that star via gravity. After it has gathered enough hydrogen, it creates a nuclear fusion, which causes the material remaining to be pushed back and the white dwarf to glow much more brightly. This cycle continues until the white dwarf "kills" the other star and it itself becomes a white dwarf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Massive white dwarfs, around 1.4 times the mass of our sun, can experience a supernova. Unlike a nova, this only happens once. This is becuase it affects the core itself, unlike a nova. A supernova is also always produced above 1.4 times our Sun's mass. In a supernova, nuclear reactions cause iron to form in the core. This blocks the star from doing fusion reactions, as any elements after iron don't produce energy when forming. The core then quickly collapses and the temperature rises very quickly as the core grows smaller. In this collapse, a ton of energy gets released and the outer layers are expelled. A ton of light gets released as well, causing supernovas to be <i>incredibly</i> bright, even somtimes more than whole galaxies. A supernova produces all naturally occurring elements and many subatomic particles.
      </p>
      <p>
          If the core of a supernova is between 1.4 and 3 solar masses, a neutron star will be produced. The star collapses on itself until the electrons and protons inside of it combine to form neutrons into a neutron star. These are super dense and have large magnetic fields, which produce rotating beams of radiation via accelerating atomic particles around its poles. If the beams occasionally sweep past the Earth, we refer to the neutron star as a pulsar.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In stars that are larger than 3 times the mass of our sun, they collapse upon death to form a black hole. These are <i>infinitely</i> dense, with such strong gravitational pulls that even light is sucked into it. We can't directly see these because our eyes are made to view photons.
