      The end of solar systems begins with the death of a star. Stars, although they typically live for billions of years, do eventually die, once they can no longer keep doing nuclear fission. This happens when all the hydrogen is used up in a star. This causes the star to collapse on itself, becoming extremely hot due to its small size. Hydrogen outside a star, still exists so it still fuses outside of the star. The collapse also causes the outer layers of the star to expel outward, which causes the star to form a red giant due to the expanding and cooling of these layers. 
Most stars, upon the end of their lifespan, become white dwarfs after they have expelled all their outer layers. White dwarfs do not collapse further due to the fast-moving electrons inside it creating pressure. Eventually, due to not being able to produce energy, these stars fade away. This will be the case with our sun one day. 
In the case of a white dwarf in a solar system made up of multiple stars, something different may happen.  It will experience novae. A nova, Latin for “new”, is when a white dwarf that is close enough to another star, pulls in hydrogen from that star using gravity. After enough hydrogen is gathered, it makes a nuclear fusion, and the material that remains is pushed back. This cycle continues until the star nearby becomes a white dwarf itself.
Massive white dwarfs, ones around 1.4 times the mass of our sun, experience a supernova. Unlike a nova, this only happens once, as it affects the core, not just the surface. In a supernova, nuclear reactions cause iron to form in the core. This means that the star cannot do any more fusion reactions, as any elements formed that are greater than iron do not produce energy. This causes the core to quickly collapse, and the temperature rises quickly as the size diminishes. In its collapse, a ton of energy is released and the outer layers are thrown outward. This also causes a ton of light to be released as well, meaning that supernovas are incredibly bright. Supernovas produce all naturally occurring elements, and many subatomic particles, as well as black holes. 
There is a point in which a white dwarf is no longer able to form. Between 1.4 and 3 solar masses, the star will collapse until its electrons and protons form neutrons, creating a neutron star. These have large magnetic fields, which create a lot of radiation.
In stars larger than 3 solar masses, when they die, they collapse and form a black hole. Black holes are incredibly dense, with gravitational pulls so strong that evenlight cannot escape its grasp. We cannot see these directly, as our eyes are made to see photons. They are observable due to this gravitational pull. When matter is dragged into a black hole, it releases a ton of gamma and X-rays, which helps us spot it. 
        
        The end of solar systems begins with the death of a star. Stars generally live for billions of years, with bigger stars living shorter lives and smaller stars living longer because it takes more energy to offset the gravitational force of a giant star than a small star. Once a star can no longer do nuclear fusion (aka it runs out of hydrogen to fuse together), it collapses on itself. This makes the star extremely hot due to both the energy of collapsing and its small size. The hydrogen outside of a star still exists, however, so it continues to fuse. This makes the star even hotter, so the outer star layers are pushed outward. As these layers expand and cool, the star becomes a red giant.

          Most stars upon the end of their lifespan become white dwarfs after all its outer layers have been pushed out, revealing an incredibly hot core. These white dwarfs do not collaspe further due to fast-moving electrons inside it creating pressure. Eventually however, these stars cool down and fade away due to not being able to produce energy anymore. This will one day be the case with our sun.

This is when a white dwarf close enough to another star pulls in hydrogen from that star via gravity. After it has gathered enough hydrogen, it creates a nuclear fusion, which causes the material remaining to be pushed back. This cycle continues until the white dwarf "kills" the other star and it itself becomes a white dwarf.
