        Gaseous planets are made up of mainly hydrogen and helium, with a rock and iron-nickel alloy core. The oxygen contained in these planets mostly is bonded with hydrogen as water. 
In our solar system, the planets closest to the sun became terrestrial, both due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, which denser objects like metals 
        would be more attracted to, and the blowing off gases due to stellar winds, which are blasts of energy and particles. 
        This is also why terrestrial planets are smaller. Likewise, the planets furthest from the sun became gas planets.
