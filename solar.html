     A solar system starts with a star, though occasionally it will be made up of multiple stars. A star is formed in a cloud of dust and gas known as a nebula, which is composed of the same elements as in a star.  The nebula contains a lot of turbulence, which create places where the nebula will collapse on itself due to the gravity there. The energy generated from the collapse causes heat to form in a core. This core is called a protostar, and the collapse continues until a star is formed. After the star is formed, the elements in it continue to react in a process known as nuclear fission. This keeps the star from collapsing.
Planets then form around the star, because the star does not use up all the dust and gas around it. The planets start off by being a flat ring of dust and gas. As time passes and more dust and gas is drawn it this ring, the dust and gas begin to form compounds and become particles, which eventually become planets.
In our solar system, the planets closest to the sun became terrestrial, both due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, which denser objects like metals would be more attracted to, and the blowing off gases due to stellar winds, which are blasts of energy and particles. This is also why terrestrial planets are smaller. Likewise, the planets furthest from the sun became gas planets. 
The asteroid belt in our solar system, where planets are pretty much unable to form, is theorized to be caused by the greatness of Jupiterâ€™s gravity preventing them from being able to come together and form.
