 A solar system starts with one (or more) stars. A star is formed from a cloud of dust and gas known as a nebula, which contains the elements needed for a star. A nebula contains a lot of turbulence, which creates places where the nebula will collapse on itself due to the gravity there. The energy generated from this collapse causes the gas and dust in the center to heat up and form a core. This core is called a protostar. The collapse may break into multiple protostars, generally two or three. The process continues until stars are formed. Not all of the dust and gas becomes a star, of course. Some material is left and ends up as planets, asteriods, comets, or just stays dust. Planets start as flat rings of dust and gas, and as more dust and gas is drawn in it begins to form compounds and particles until the planet takes shape.</p>
<p>
  
      In our solar system, the dust and gas closest to the sun became terrestrial, both due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, which denser objects like metals would be more attracted to, and the blowing off gases due to stellar winds, which are blasts of energy and particles. This is also why terrestrial planets are smaller. Likewise, the planets furthest from the sun became gas planets. 
The asteroid belt in our solar system, where planets are pretty much unable to form, is theorized to be caused by the greatness of Jupiterâ€™s gravity preventing them from being able to come together and form.
